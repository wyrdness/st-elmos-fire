      "summary": "Electrical weather phenomenon creating glowing blue/violet plasma on pointed objects during storms. Fully explained as corona discharge.",
      "full": "St. Elmo's Fire is a well-understood electrical weather phenomenon that creates a characteristic blue or violet glow on pointed objects such as ship masts, aircraft nose cones and wings, church steeples, and mountain peaks during thunderstorms or other conditions of high atmospheric electricity. The phenomenon is caused by corona discharge—the ionization of air molecules in strong electric fields. Named after St. Erasmus of Formia (St. Elmo), patron saint of sailors, it has been documented for millennia and was historically considered a good omen by mariners. Unlike lightning, St. Elmo's Fire is relatively harmless, though it indicates the presence of strong electrical fields. The physics of corona discharge are well established, making this a fully EXPLAINED atmospheric phenomenon. It appears during thunderstorms, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and any situation creating sufficient atmospheric electricity."
